== Lab Overview

=== Step 1. Create a basic deployment

In this step, we'll create a basic nginx *Deployment Object* using Kubernetes and check the status of the rollout.

$ `kubectl run nginx --image nginx`
....
deployment "nginx" created
....

Now check the status of the Deployments rollout using

$ `kubectl rollout status deployment nginx`

This should return the following:
....
deployment "nginx" successfully rolled out
....

NOTE: For larger deployments, the rollout status will show the status of the rollout.

Let's take a quick look at the Kubernetes objects created.

$ `kubectl get all`
....
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/nginx-3447197284-whqkl   1/1       Running   0          4m

NAME             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
svc/kubernetes   100.64.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   9m

NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/nginx   1         1         1            1           4m

NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rs/nginx-3447197284   1         1         1         4m
....

NOTE: Three Kubernetes objects were created


TIP: You can also use the dashboard to see the deployment

image::deployments_step_1.png[600,600]

=== Step 2. Looking at existing deployments

$ `kubectl get deployments`

....
NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx             1         1         1            0        10 m
....

WARNING: The above commands will only output the deployments of the selected namespace, which by default is "default."

TIP: When wanting to output the deployments of other namespaces uses the `--namespace` switch

Run the following to see the obecti

To look at their values; run `kubectl get deployments -o json`

DESIRED::
This shows the number of desired replicas, this is defined by the (`.spec.replicas`)

....
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 1,
        "selector": {
            "matchLabels": {
                "run": "nginx"
            }
....

CURRENT::
This shows the number of current replicas, this is defined by the (`.status.replicas`)

....
    "status": {
        "replicas": 1,
....


UP-TO-DATE::
This shows the number of up-to-date replicas in the deployment (`.status.updatedReplicas`)

....
    "status": {
        "updatedReplicas": 1
....

AVAILABLE::
This shows the number of pods available for being updated (`.status.availableReplicas`)

....
    "status": {
        "unavailableReplicas": 1,
....

AGE::
This shows the age of the deployment.

....
metadata:
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: "1"
  creationTimestamp: 2017-05-23T16:17:48Z
....

=== Step 3. Looking deeper at a deployment
Looking at more detail of a Kubernetes Deployment Object.

$ `kubectl describe deployment <deployment_name>`

$ `kubectl describe deploy/<deployment_name>`

TIP: Both above methods achieve the same result.

.Truncated output of the above commands
....
Name:			nginx
Namespace:		default
CreationTimestamp:	Tue, 23 May 2017 10:56:15 -0700
Labels:			run=nginx
Annotations:		deployment.kubernetes.io/revision=1
Selector:		run=nginx
Replicas:		1 desired | 1 updated | 1 total | 1 available | 0 unavailable
StrategyType:		RollingUpdate ...
....

NOTE: The describe command doesn't work with the -o (output) switch. This is namely due to how the describe commands collects the data points required to present the data.


=== Step 4. Scaling the deployment

By default, all deployments are deployed with a ReplicationController and a `--replica` value of 1. Notice in the previous step, *Replicas* has a value of 1. Thus, let's add more `--replicas` to the nginx deployment.

$ `kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 10`
....
deployment "nginx" scaled
....

Let's take a closer look at the deployment.

$ `kubectl get deployment nginx`
....
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx     10        10        10           10          28m
....

Let's delete the deployment `nginx`

$ `kubectl delete deployment nginx`
....
service "kubernetes" deleted
....

=== Step 5. Create a Deployment Manifest

Create a file called `nginx.yaml` and populate it with the following content.

....
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.11-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
....

Let's create a deployment from it using the `*kubectl create*` command.

$ `kubectl create -f nginx.yaml`
....
deployment "nginx" created
....

NOTE: Writing manifest is the better means to deploying Kubernetes objects.


=== Step 6. Check the status of the manifest

Run a check to see the status of the `rollout`

$ `kubectl rollout status deployment nginx`
....
deployment "nginx" successfully rolled out
....

$ `kubectl get all`
....
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/nginx-2371676037-4cpr0   1/1       Running   0          15m

NAME             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
svc/kubernetes   100.64.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   25m

NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/nginx   1         1         1            1           15m

NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rs/nginx-2371676037   1         1         1         15m
....

NOTE: The same objects were created by the manifest.

=== Step 7.



=== Step 8. Resource Management (CPU/RAM)

There are many cases where resources may need to be limited; in these cases, we can add the resources spec to the `spec: container` section of the `yaml` file.

....
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.11-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "128Mi"
....

NOTE: Defining resource is especially useful in defining the minimum required resources for a pod. In the above example, the container is only deployable to a system with .5 CPU (1/2 Core). Once deployed to a system with .5 core available, the container will consume all CPU until another container is deployed into the pod.

TIP: This helps the scheduler avoid resource shortages.

=== Step 9. Labels

Let's create some nginx pod with labels, first from the command-line and next from a `yaml` file. Let's create one for prod and one for test. Let's also define the app, in this case, let's use `nginx`.

....
$ kubectl run nginx-prod \
    --image=nginx:1.11-alpine \
    --replicas=3 \
    --labels="app=nginx,env=prod"
....

....
$ kubectl run nginx-test \
    --image=nginx:1.9.10 \
    --replicas=2 \
    --labels="app=nginx,env=test"
....

NOTE: Labels are the only way to group Kubernetes objects.

$ `kubectl get pods`

$ `kubectl get pods --selector="app=nginx"`

$ `kubectl get pods --selector="env=prod"`

$ `kubectl get pods --selector="env=test"`

Let's create another pod that runs apache.

....
$ kubectl run httpd-test \
    --image=httpd:alpine \
    --replicas=2 \
    --labels="app=httpd,env=test"
....

Let's run the following to see the different ways a label can be queried.

First, let's select all pods where `app=nginx`

$ `kubectl get pods --selector="app=nginx"`

Now, let's select all pods where `app=httpd`

$ `kubectl get pods --selector="app=httpd"`


$ `kubectl get pods --selector="env=test"`

TIP: One or more labels can be used with the `--selector` switch.

$ `kubectl get pods --selector="env=test,app=nginx"`
