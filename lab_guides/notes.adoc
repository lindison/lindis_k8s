= Notes for looking into stuff

What is --service-node-port-range in Kubernetes? 

By default, services can only run on ports 30000 - 32767. 


== Service

Selector  

nodePort  

targetPort  

== kubectl 

`kubectl get deployments`

`kubectl get rs`

== Setting up Kubernetes Dashboard (with Vagrant)

When the system is up and running; run `kubectl cluster-info` and take note if dashboard shows up. 

....
18:26:05 â€º kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://172.17.4.101:443
Heapster is running at https://172.17.4.101:443/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster
KubeDNS is running at https://172.17.4.101:443/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns
kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://172.17.4.101:443/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard
....

If it does, run `kubectl proxy --port 9090` or whatever port is available. 

Once this is up; open a new terminal and connect to `http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard` and this will open your Kubernetes Dashboard.  

NOTE: Not sure if this works for everything just yet but makes sense if it does. 

TIP: You can also deploy using a yaml that deploys teh dashboard.
